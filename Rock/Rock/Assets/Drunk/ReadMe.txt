Thank you for choosing "[QDY] Drunk"! :)
This is an effect asset that reproduce how drunk man see the world.

There are two folders in asset.
The "BuiltIn" folder contains shader and material that can be used in built-in render pipeline.
The "URP" folder contains shader and material that can be used in universal render pipeline.
"DemoBuiltIn.unity" and "DemoURP.unity" demonstrate how to use them.
There are plenty of parameters to control drunk effect, for highly customizable variations.

Demo scene demonstrates all features, please take a look and have fun with it.
Open demo scene and click the play button, I guess you will feel drunken.

If you like it, please encourage us a good review on asset store. We will keep moving !
Any question, suggestion or requesting, please contact qdy-assets@qq.com.
Hope we can help more and more unity3d developers.
